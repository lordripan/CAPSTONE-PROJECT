    "## Analysis on observation:\n",
    "### As we see in observation in most of the states crime events and literacy rate both are increased between 2001 and 2011. Some factors are responsible for this:\n",
    "#### As literacy increases peoples are aware about their rights  and number of FIRs registered are increases which increase the number of events in data.\n",
    "#### As literacy increases but if number of jobs in private and Govt. sectors are not increases then peoples are involved in illegal activities.\n",
    "#### As in our country most of the people belongs to below middle class and technical, management and health education are costly for them so they are graduate from arts subjects. This trend increase the data of literacy but jobs available in arts field  are highly competitive so these students are going to be unemployed in most of the time of their life, this condition increases the probablity of involving them in illegal activities.\n",
    "#### One of the trend we see that if a person in involved in illegal activities in condition of any circumstances and he is convicted to jail, then his carrier is also breakes not only for Govt. jobs but also for good private jobs so the probablity of this person in returning in crime field is increases.\n",
    "#### Data shows that most of people involved in illegal activities are less literate or illetrate.But Litrate criminals are more dangerous for the society like Harshad mehta, Ketan parikh etc. Shiv Kheda says an illetrate theif theft some thing from a rail, but a literate thief theft the railway track.\n",
    "#### As literacy increases but if opportunities are not available in local areas so people are going in metropoliton cities for good opportunities this makes people vulnarable. One of reason is that their local people thinks they grabed their opportunities.\n",
    "#### In metropoliton cities where womens are comes for jobs and when they are doing their night shifts they are easily assaulted by criminals because literacy gives you knowledge which helps in earning money but not the security.\n",
    "#### In north eastern region one of reason of raising crime graph is AFSPA. Assult cases against womens are done by armed forces. Hence literacy rate is also increases so rate of filing complaint also increases.\n",
    "#### In Kerala literacy rate is very high but crime cases are also high and so on rate of conviction of criminals is also high. The reson is simple lack of opportunities in comparison to literate people and one of the reason i think that their is marksist govt. and according to Marks philosophy 'power origin comes from guns bullet' so police is high powered this raise the peoples involved in normal crimes are also urrested which breakes their image in society and carrier so problity of these person's for returning in illegal activities is high.\n",
    "#### In Rajasthan and Haryana region cultural and social trend are also responsible for increasing crime against womens because of that killed girl child at birth, child marriage and if a girl/women is literate and she is raising voice against socio/cultural trend then she face the anger of society in face of honour killing.\n",
    "#### In Bihar and UP in lower and upper middle class their is a society trend they are preparing for high prestigious govt. jobs like IAS and PCS, hence these jobs are highly competitive and seats are limited so most of the students are getting unemployed in the productive time of their life, so on these students are highly educated so they want to show their talent, and therefore age for small jobs are gone so the chances of moving them in illegal activities are also increases that we seen in Apahran movie.\n",
    "#### In Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, MP, West Bengal there are so many tribal peoples now days they are educated but according to their culturel trend they are highly attached withe their geographical environment and if govt. wants to use their lands and forest for industrial purpose they fight with govt. peoples for their 'jal, jungle, zameen'(water, forest, land), so their conflicts with armed forces increases."

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "### Proper and fair investigation should be done by police persons because so much bogus complaints are registered by people.\n",
    "### Expand the economic infrastructure which is based on local area circumstances like social, economical, geographical, political it also mentioned in the directive principles of our constitution and it is also vision of Mahatama Gandhi.\n",
    "### Education loan facility should be easily available to every student for higher studies and repayment policy is also based on their degree after job income.\n",
    "### Age of high post comptetive exam should be reduced it saves the importent productive year of students.\n",
    "### If people's who are involved in low level crime then after their punishment make the way for them from which they return to the society with clean image that means due to their punishment  their carrier is not breakdown atleast.\n",
    "### Moral values are also add with education which teach people how to live in society and how to perform in any circumstance.\n",
    "### Make police men behaviour people's friendly, so people feel  police men's are not here for ruling them but they are for their security, this habit is being practised in developed nation and due to this most of the crime are handled before they happen because police get the information from local peoples of any suspecious activity this reduces the crime graph.\n",
    "### Goverment should also take help of khap panchayt and religious guru's in spreading scientific proved modern thoughts like women's marriage age >18 is in the favour of mother and child, and literacy and women's participation in economic activities make the women's strong and this is in the favour of men's also because it reduces the men's financial, educational and security burden of running their family\n",
    "### Proper and fair investigation should be done in case of tribal assaults against armed forces also and most importent govt. should watch carefully that policies made by them for tribal persons and their property rights are properly implemented or not, this step increase the trust of tribal people on goverment and also industrial activities are done on barren land or any other place not in the place of dense forest and agricultural land.\n"
